About
---
SdlSharpened is an OOP layer over SDL2-CS. SDL2-CS is a set of C# bindings for SDL2.
The aim of SdlSharpened is to make SDL2 easier to use, from within C#, by providing 
intuitive object-oriented interfaces to common SDL2 components; whilst also removing 
the noise of the 'SDL_' prefixes, as well as offering such niceties as RAII and 
SDL2 wiki excerpts appearing in IntelliSense.
